# MedBot - Medical Information Chatbot 🤖

Welcome to **MedBot**! This chatbot leverages the **Llama 2 model** (quantized version: `llama-2-7b-chat.ggmlv3.q8_0`) to provide accurate and informative responses to medical queries. MedBot is designed to assist users with questions about common medical conditions, symptoms, and general health advice. It uses **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** to enhance its knowledge base by dynamically retrieving information from two datasets:  

1. **Gale Encyclopedia of Medicine**  
2. **Basic about health and medicine**  

With the power of Llama 2 and these rich datasets, MedBot offers detailed, contextually relevant answers to help users better understand their health concerns. Please note that MedBot is intended for **informational purposes only** and should not be used as a substitute for professional medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
